# Predictive-Models-for-Equipment-Fault-Detection---Secom-Dataset

Various Machine Learning models are fitted to the dataset and the performances are analyzed. The model with optimal performance is chosen to predict the yield of the semiconductor manufacturing process.

The data involves a special statistical scenario called Rare Events, in which, the frequency of occurence of a particular class of response variable is extremely low. Hence, sampling techniques are employed at the data pre-processing stage.
